    %{<p>
      Not for the first time in several years, Nigerians have watched helpless as the face-off between the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, and the Federal government threatens the already rickety
      foundations of education in Nigeria. While the youths are on the streets, joining hunger-ravaged citizens forming a reserve army of militants and boko haram-ites,
      the Federal Government and ASUU are going about the negations as if there were
      really nothing at stake. Pity  that they
      cannot see the handwriting on the already imploding walls of not just the
      citadels but also of the entire society! This
      long faceoff  has become  symptomatic of  governance in Nigeria, loaded as it is with
      ingredients of  nonchalance,
      insensitivity and callousness and, infact, barefaced provocation.</p>
      <p>

      It would have been interesting to stand aloof and see how
      things play out, from a safe distance,
      but the stakes are too high for that. The shame of it all is that the
      government negotiators and ASSUU do not seem to be on the same page. While
      government takes a line item approach, ticking off specific items over which it
      claims to have met the Union's demands (eg 40 per cent pay rise, 70 year
      retirement age etc), the Union on the other hand, while conceding these
      trickle-downs, insists on addressing the big picture. It wants the government to
      fund education to the point that we would not have to relapse into these
      parlous positions that drag us back to these conferences of clenched fists on a
      recurring basis. To the extent that ASUU has made this struggle a call for
      adequate  funding of education, they  have our full support at the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE
      AND HUMAN RIGHTS (ISSJHR).  </p>
      <p>

      We understand that ASUU's fear is that the systemic decay
      that has ravaged primary and secondary segments of public education should not
      be allowed to further infest university education. Too late, for we already
      know that by the time the products of these segments  get into the universities  via the corruption-ridden JAMB and JME exams,
      they are already grist for the mills of cultists and other  purveyors of social deviance. </p>
      <p>

      The government must show more  commitment to education. So far, we do not
      see enough evidence in that regard. For starters, education of one's children
      in public schools including universities IN NIGERIA should be a criterion for
      confirmation of any Federal Minister. Those ministers whose children/wards are
      already enjoying  quality education
      outside must either bring those students back to Nigeria, or resign their
      appointments. When we are all home and looking at the problems of education
      from the same perspective, then perhaps, we can begin a genuine search for a
      solution. Also, ASUU must call their members to order. Our backing of their
      position does not in any exculpate their members from the corruption and
      immorality that ravages our higher institutions. The imperative of sanitizing
      education is as much the government's call as it is ASUU's.</p>})

    %{<p>
      It is not quite in our line of duty to issue commendations to any government in Nigeria. Not because we are cut out to criticize, but because, as anyone will easily testify, it is hard to see anything worth commending in the type of governance that has been foisted on the people by the various tiers of government in Nigeria in recent years.
      </p>

      <p>
      Today we want to make an exception to that rule. We have seen enough in Rivers State in the last two or so years to commend Governor Chibuike Amaechi. In doing this, we are not being carried away by civil construction and other activities of his government, but we are pleased to note that these sundry activities derive from a VISION, and underscore a desire to uplift the standard of living of the people of the state.  To the extent that having a mandate and working towards meeting that mandate counts, Governor Amaechi is spot on. Not that we are in El Dorado now; no, very far from it; but it is refreshing to witness a concerted effort to redefine governance as WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE.   The International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights (ISSJHR) commends Governor Amaechi for his open door policy which tallies with a vision that has seen the government and the governed in mutual embrace.
      </p>

      <p>
      At the same time, we caution that the governor is not immune to being distracted. To remain focused, the government must resist the antics of self-seeking politicians who would only draw back the hand of the clock. Also, contractors handling various projects in the state must adhere strictly to specifications and must ensure prompt delivery so as to provide the people the dividends of democracy. Anything short of this, such contractors should await our lawsuits.
      </p>

      <p>
      IN CONTRAST: ET TU OHAKIM!
      </p>

      <p>
      The ISSJHR also condemns in unequivocal terms, the spate of defections of sitting governors to other parties. Governors   Adamu Aliero/Usman Maitankari (Kebbi: ANPP to PDP), Isa Yuguda (Bauchi:.ANPP to PDP), Aliyu Shinkafi (Zamfara: ANPP to PDP) and now Imo State's Ikedi Ohakim (PPA to PDP) have all elevated political opportunism to stellar heights. We are not in the least swayed by the extenuating circumstances pleaded by their supporters and hangers-on to justify this perfidy. Accepting those excuses would be tantamount to taking political expediency to absurd levels. Just when discerning members of the public were beginning to look favourably towards the Imo Governor, for instance, the man thrown up  by the degeneracy  of his erstwhile party, the PDP,  has himself spun a political sleight of hand, joining the parade of dogs going back to their own vomits. This is a monumental fraud, not made any less so by the argument that, again in the case of Ohakim, the platform that elected him, the PPA, has only a solo member in a PDP dominated House of Assembly. The 1999 Constitution that set out very clear and strict conditions under which a sitting governor or President could cross carpet was not unaware of the conditions they are supposedly blanketing themselves against. The Constitution is not particularly concerned about the political fate of an individual office holder as the survival of the constitution itself. The defections are a betrayal of the electorates' trust and a flagrant rape of the constitution the defecting governors all swore to protect.
      </p>

      <p>
      The manifesto of each party constitutes the only valid agreement between the electorate and that party. It is therefore immoral and reckless   for any governor to renege on that agreement at the point of implementation The ISSJHR therefore calls on Ohakim and the other constitution-spiting governors to resign and face the electorate of their various states with their new party manifestos. This rape of the Constitution must stop.

    :information =>
    %{<p>
      It did not quite come to us as a surprise that recently the House of Representatives voted down a bill that was aimed at immortalizing the acclaimed winner of the June 12 Presidential elections in Nigeria, Bashorun MKO Abiola. It would have been out of character for the majority of the Reps whose sense of patriotism is as questionable as the validity of their own 'victory, in the flawed elections that brought them to the hallowed halls of the House of Representatives.
      </p>

      <p>
      For majority of the Reps that voted down the bill, it was an outright display of callousness,  callousness  that underscores their lack of a  sense of history; callousness that is fed by their obnoxious sense of conquest: men and women who have turned the  time-honoured and sober duty of representation into plumage for their otherwise naked selves. When 'elected' representatives exhibit no qualms  in cornering the greater part of our national estate for themselves, and looking the other way as the executive they are expected to check-and-balance act with  financial recklessness and criminal impunity, it would be asking too much to expect the same Reps to see the point in honouring Bashorun Abiola,  let alone, immortalize him. We recognize however, that there were others, especially those that put up even the less-than-attractive argument that June 12, the event, could be celebrated as a historic event  and should be separated from  Abiola the man.
      </p>

      <p>
      We see no great merit in the attempt to draw an imaginary line between the event  JUNE 12, and the personage that called it forth, Bashorun ABIOLA.  In more historically conscious climes, the man's statue would by now be adorning our national institutions.
      </p>

      <p>
      We must however commend Rep Patrick Obahiagbon (PDP, EDO) who sponsored the bill, and the bipartisan, if tenuous, support it was able to garner from the few members so persuaded
      </p>

      <p>
      On the anniversary of June 12, the International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights called for a declaration of that date as the authentic Democracy Day. We still hold onto that. We also wholeheartedly support Rep Obahiagbon's bill asking that the man whose ultimate sacrifice led to the (even if imperfect) democracy we are enjoying today, be immortalized. Those who have seen the significance of June 12 in Nigeria's march to nationhood ought also to see the signature of the personage that gave it forth; separating the two is a mere academic exercise. Immortalizing Abiola does not elevate him to the status of a saint, nor does it make him any less of a human being with natural foibles and character flaws. These  should not detract from his significance as a rallying point for a national rebirth anchored on popular will and merit-driven ethos rather than religious and ethnic and kleptomaniac cleavages that currently bedevil the nation.

      Even in normal circumstances, the location of an institution such as a University of Petroleum Technology should be a function of various variables chief of which should be the closeness to the sources of the petroleum resource itself. This should be elementary logic. But then, these are not quite normal circumstances for   the Nigerian Nation State.
      </p>

      <p>
      Indeed if there were no existing institution and one was only now being contemplated, such should naturally be sited in the Niger Delta. It becomes all the more reprehensible then for someone to contemplate the relocation of an existing institution, or an advanced, upgraded version of it, from the Niger Delta to another part of the country.  The news that the University of Petroleum Technology would be sited in Kaduna, far from the oil-yielding sands of the Niger Delta beggars logic. If true, this is not only callous, it is a bare faced provocation at these highly inflammable times. If somebody is asleep at the Petroleum Ministry or at the Presidency or at whatever caucus meeting such a decision was taken, it's time to wake up!
      </p>

      <p>
      The International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights (ISSJHR) calls on the Federal Government to make a definitive statement to the effect that the proposed University of Petroleum Technology, whether as a start-up institution or as an upgrade of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) Effurun, should be, and remain, in the Niger Delta.  In fact, given the strategic importance of oil in the economy of Nigeria and the even more vital role that resource and its derivatives are set to play in the global economy in the years ahead, it is our view that The PTI Effurun be upgraded to a multi-tiered, medium and high level human capital training institution, while another institution be established in another part of the Niger Delta oil producing community. Several other low-to-medium petroleum and polytechnical institutes could then be spread in several parts of the Niger Delta including the South East and Ondo State; each of these could have a specific focus on the upstream, refining/downstream or service sector.
      </p>

      <p>
      Funding could come from savings from a genuine anti-corruption campaign and from the annual unspent budget allocations which are yearly shared by civil servants or part-returned to the treasury. The institutions would, among other benefits, provide jobs to teeming Niger Delta and other Nigerian youths now forming a large reserve army of militants and social deviants in the absence of positive engagement opportunities.
      </p>

      <p>
      Let the University of Petroleum, whether old or new remain in the Niger Delta. This is time to calm frayed nerves, not to make incendiary pronouncements.

    :information =>
    %{<p>
      The history of the Islamic Republic of Iran is filled with martyrs most of whom are justifiably held in awesome reverence by the Iranian people. We do not believe that Miss Neda Soltan was, or intended to be, one of them. But that's where the current of history is pushing her to, inexorably, as that country rides the storm of electoral hanky-panky.
      </p>

      <p>
      Miss Soltan, a neophyte perhaps in her very early twenties, was among numerous others gunned down by Iranian security forces or their proxies as they were demonstrating peacefully against the official results of the elections.  "Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association", states Article 20 (1) of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights (1948) to which Iran is a signatory. This is one of numerous guarantees Miss Soltan could have sought remedy in, but alas, she is no longer able to press any claims.
      </p>

      <p>
      The murder of NEDA is cowardly. It's an outrage to the entire human race especially those who love the sweet scent of justice. How could they mow down in cold blood a young innocent girl in the name of containing protests. The best way to contain  protest is to avoid the actions or events that stirred such protests. This should be an elementary lesson which we thought the authorities in Iran already knew. How wrong we were! Now, much to the anger and further embarrassment of the Iranian regime, NEDA has become a rallying cry for people from across the globe, from Canberra in the southern hemisphere to Washington in the north, and from Istanbul to Caracas. This goes to show that our creed and political orientation, even our skin pigmentation may differ, but at heart, we are one; our hearts beat to the same rhythm. More important still, the spontaneity of the global expressions of outrage not only for NEDA but also for all other victims of this Iranian twist of the sword should be a pointer to the hegemonists in Teheran that their days of acting with impunity are long gone.
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>The International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights</b> seeks justice for Neda Soltan and others massacred or maimed by the Iranian regime or its proxies. Since there is no way of atoning for human life, we urge the Ahmedinejad regime  to subscribe to some minimum guarantees for the people of Iran. We suggest as a starting point the implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights including the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 18) and freedom of the press.
      </p>

      <p>
       We doubt if NEDA can be brought back to life, but if the government shows enough intent to rectifying some of the anomalous situations she risked her life for, then she and her comrades would not have died in vain. And while at it, they should know that ballot box infidelity sucks, whether it is in Abuja or Teheran.

    :information =>
    %{<p>
      The amnesty recently granted Niger Delta militants is, on the face of it, a good gesture. But for it to become
      effective ie, to prompt the set of actions it is meant to prompt, it has to be seen to be  genuine and
      realistic, and from a government that is truly  well-meaning. Otherwise the whole exercise (the offer and
      the acceptance) could end up as a piece of propaganda and another in the set of pawns on a chessboard except
      that this particular chessboard is no play thing but tragically, a killing field.
      </p>

      <p>
      At THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS, we do not wish to draw back the hand of the clock as far as peace-making in the Niger delta goes, but we are constrained to make this intervention, having observed the apparent lack of genuineness on the part of both the federal government and the militants (both the organized and un-organized segments thereof) which lack of genuineness is demonstrated in the continuous state of conflict despite  the proclamation of the amnesty some weeks back. To have an effective amnesty and the peace it is meant to engender, the parties need to understand the very basis of the current  armed struggle itself. The government needs to understand that the youths were driven to this extreme situation when, it appeared, all other peaceful options could not draw the desired response from the government. The youths/militants on their part need to understand (and we hope we are right) that this struggle itself is for the good of the people, not for some narrow selfish goals as has been manifesting lately.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, given the vast field of play, we believe the onus is on the government to show a proper understanding of the situation and act accordingly. They should show more magnanimity since they are the father of all. They should know:

      <ol>
        <li>That the militants were driven to arms in the first instance due to the behaviour of the government ie, present and, in particular, past regimes that took the oil producing communities for granted.</li>

        <li>Given the long history of neglect, what the Niger Delta region needs is massive investment and ameliorative interventions; therefore  insisting on a mere 13 per cent derivation funds is an act of insensitivity. That  figure has to rise to somewhere between 40 to 50 percent not only as a sign of intent, but also in view of the geography and the  environmental degradation to which it had been criminally subjected over the years.</li>

        <li>Environmental standards such as effluent  quality,  flare quantity,  environmental impact assessment, (EIA)etc, should be aligned to international standards.</li>

        <li>Post-amnesty, the government should convene a Sovereign National Conference (SNC) for which the people have been clamouring .</li>
      </ol>

      </p>

      <p>
      None of these should be new to the government. What should be new is the resolve to compressively address the seemingly intractable problems of not only the Niger delta but all the oil bearing communities in Nigeria. To echo Karl Marx, the government has nothing to lose but their pains; they have a world of peace and investible field to gain.

      For more than two week now, the Federal Government's military organ in the Niger Delta, the - Joint Task Force (JTF) - has sustained a military offensive in the Region, principally in key towns and villages said to be the hotbed of militancy and abode of men on the Task Force's 'wanted' List.
      </p>

      <p>
      We have, consequently, watched with horror as death tolls rise in the creeks and families continue to recount tales of woe. Even innocent citizens and residents, including youth corpers, caught up in the crossfire, have been subjected to unspeakable hardship. This is an avoidable collateral damage.
      </p>

      <p>
      Ostensibly, the purpose of the offensive is to flush out the militants and their so-called collaborators. But this purpose, it itself, cannot stand as a justification of this blitzkrieg; it must be tied to a larger, nobler cause such as creating an environment for meaningful peace to be negotiated, or indeed creating the right atmosphere for individuals and organizations to engage in their legitimate economic activities. In order words, any peace must serve THE PEOPLE's well being. So what would be the point of vanquishing the people just to install peace?
      </p>

      <p>
      We call on all parties to the conflict to sheathe their swords. This bloodletting must stop. The International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights (ISSJHR) calls on the Federal government to rein in the JTF.  We wonder whether the Rules of Engagement, if any were in place, were well defined or properly communicated to the combatants. Simply put: granted that the objectives were tenable in the first instance, how do we know when the men in the field have exceeded their brief?  The huge collateral damage to this offensive is unacceptable.
      </p>

      <p>
       We also call on the militants, kidnappers and all manner of social miscreants that have hijacked the people's legitimate struggle to let off. It is appalling that even the little gains of the agitation such as road networks (e.g. the East-West road) are being eroded by work stoppages occasioned by kidnappings and sabotage. It is bad enough that the people of the Niger Delta have suffered so much at the hands of outside taskmasters; it smacks of the cruelest form of sado-masochism when that suffering is inflicted by Niger Deltans themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
      This region has long been starved of development. The spate of withdrawals of companies from the region on account of the peace deficit does not serve to stem this trend; it rather exacerbates it. This is why we insist that combatants must lay down their arms. For many in the creeks peace is a long memory. It need not be so.

      When a land is so bereft of men of iconic stature, it is  almost inevitable that  whenever one is found, he or she  invariably becomes the object of adulation, adoration even, by his countrymen and women. Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola is more than that iconic figure in contemporary Nigerian politics: he represents an ideal, the sum of all our missing parts. He is a telling rebuke to all who still insist that Nigeria is best defined by its ethnic or religious configurations. Abiola is (don't worry, we know our tenses) the very epitome of largeheartedness. Nationalistic, exuberant and full of native wisdom, he  represents a  spirit distillable only from the unadulterated hearts of our founding fathers. Still, he was human and therefore not devoid of his own share of human foibles
      </p>

       <p>
      Since June 12 is intractably bound up with the life and travails of that unwisely-discarded beacon, we must mark that date with a keen sense of history. This means that we must draw the correct lessons. And we must move on.. It is tempting to celebrate his demise rather than what he stood for, or indeed what has stood for him, ie true democracy and the sacrosanctness of the ballot box.
      </p>

       <p>
          The International Society for Social Justice and Human Rights (ISSJHR) therefore holds that the best way to honour him would be to hold aloft the banner of true democracy and electoral fidelity  that he has come to symbolize for the world's largest concentration of black people. Turning it into a memorabilia of hagiography by those with dubious intent honors neither him nor the nation he was martyred for. He would be the first person, were he still on these side of eternity, to advise against it.

       <p>
       It is disheartening that fifth columnists, turncoats and barefaced traitors of June 12 have joined the sainthood carnival procession  bandwagon.  But while Bashorun MKO Abiola has assumed a larger-than-life image, he was also human and therefore subject to human foibles. All these pink praise, all these carnival revelry  from fifth columnists is nauseating. It seems to be  configured not to serve the martyr's  posthumous interests, but those of the some people now positioning to reap from where they did not sow. June 12 has become a national symbol of longed for rebirth; let us draw the lessons and move on to June 13, the day after. The question that should agitate any democracy-minded patriot is : why are we stuck with May 29 as so-called democracy day when June 12 is still staring us in the face, our guilt-laden face?
      </p>

       <p>
      We therefore call on the Federal government to Declare June 12 as the true Democracy Day. And we call on Nigerian patriots to  appropriate the lesson of June 12 and hold steadfast onto it. With the new spirit sweeping through the globe, the time to apply those lessons is not far off.

We insist that the Governor   go for people who have fully bought into his vision of repositioning the State by raising the Standard of living of her citizens and residents. Those who have performed creditably in the current dispensation and who have a firm grasp of the blueprint of the current administration could be retained in the cabinet while fresh faces full of zeal,  energy and a sense of mission  could be added. While not appearing overly political or partisan, a few outgoing commissioners exhibited core competence, discipline and dedication in the discharge of their mandates.

    :information =>
    %{<p>
      When a country reflects on ten years of continuous democracy, one would expect a reel-off of what has come to be known in these parts as 'dividends of democracy'. You would expect to see thresholds reached and milestone passed, on the arguably uneven road to that much cherished ideal, but sadly for Nigeria, it has been more of tales of what might have been. Those who had warned, ten years ago, that the quality of institutions in place
      and the personnel manning them would not take us through the democratic road might now be permitted to gloat at the accuracy of their doom prophecies, but they would be doing so at their own peril, for they are as much victims of their prediction's success as they are of its failure.
      </p>

       <p>
      Clearly, it is naive to expect, within a period of ten years, the blossoming of democracy in a land that had been mired in dictatorship and autocracy; a land that had, in fact between 1960 and 1999, only known democracy as an interregnum; but it is legitimate to expect that having divested itself of its suffocating military/dictatorship garb, the country should, at least, have laid the foundations of a democratic society.
      </p>

       <p>
      Sadly, again, most, if not all, the beacons that should light up our road to democracy have been obfuscated in shrouds corruption, ineptitude and sometimes brazen kleptomania. The first post-military regime in the current dispensation regaled the citizenry with neo-military swagger and intemperate diktat, pills we could have, nonetheless, swallowed as a necessary part of the transition process, and as part of the healing therapy for  decades of military-inflicted nausea, but alas, this was happening alongside the  sowing and watering of the seeds of hydra-headed corruption, brigandage  and megalomania. The follow-up regime, sadly too, has not fared  better. Trumpeting the mantra of law-and-order, it seems to be looking the other way while its agents and surrogates (real or self-imposd)  fleece the nation of not only its resources but also its democratic credentials. We may be adorned in  civilian garbs, but everywhere the taste of military rule pervades.

      If there were any cathartic or purgative benefits for so doing, we would have listed the lurid report card of the last ten years here, but what does someone gain by recounting tales of their own rape? Need we remind ourselves of an executive that has reveled in profligacy, made a virtue of recyclocracy (rulership by  recycling) and has abandoned people-orientation? Need we remind ourselves of a legislature (upper, lower chambers), normatively positioned as a check on the executive but which has turned out to be not just an accomplice but a perpetrator in its own (pecuniary) rights? Need we dwell on the judiciary that can, in one breath, give epochal, heart-lifting verdicts and, in another, raise eyebrows with its pro-kleptocracy verdicts, and then hide in its corruption-infested  gowns? How about institutions and organs that should support democracy: education: a joke that would have been worth laughing at were it not so tragic! The police: no comment! Do we have the stomach to talk about the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that has made Nigeria the butt of electoral jokes and tarred her so irredeemably as to make re-branding futile?   Was it not the state itself that ceded part of its own land to Cameroun after being hoodwinked into signing the infamous Green Tree Agreement to purportedly give effect to an International Court of Justice ruling on Bakassi?  For most Bakassians today, the most visible dividend of democracy is economic and cultural privation  and a sense of confused identity, having been betrayed out of their ancestral lands by a regime that swore to defend and protect them.

      We have observed with deep concern the deteriorating political situation in Ekiti State consequent upon the shoddy and insensitive manner the re-run elections in that State were conducted.
      </p>

       <p>
      The 	ISSJGG wishes to condemn the sad but entirely avoidable turn of events, and calls on the Federal Government of Nigeria through its relevant agencies particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to take immediate steps to remedy the glaring anomalies observed during the elections and save the image of the country from further battering.
      </p>

       <p>
      The Federal Government must respect and uphold the inalienable rights of the people to choose their leaders in a free and fair contest. To achieve this the Government's electoral organ- the INEC- must  be the epitome and exemplar of  fairness and impartiality. It must not be teleguided directly or surreptitiously by government or its agents, whether or not such agents are acting with the overt or tacit prodding of their principals. The Commission must not be gagged, intimidated or stampeded. On its part, the Commission and the Resident Electoral Commissioner must display not only sound judgment but also courage and tenacity, and above all, transparency.
      </p>

       <p>
      The reported resignation, and later, self-reinstatement,  as it were,  of the Ekiti Resident Electoral Commissioner is bizarre and shameful. It is indeed sad that in the midst of current talk of Branding and Vision 20:2020, the country has failed to hoist the flag of Good People, Great Nation by not taking the unique opportunity of the rerun elections to correct the ignominious impressions created by the anomalies of previous ones around the country.
      </p>

       <p>
      It is time to cleanse the stables, starting with the opportunity that the Ekiti rerun presents. The state's inexorable slide into anarchy is entirely avoidable. We call for an independent ombudsman who will not only keep the political actors accountable, but will most importantly act as a check to the electoral referees themselves. Ekiti and indeed Nigeria deserve no less. The time to act is now.
